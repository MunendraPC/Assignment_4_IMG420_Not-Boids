🎯 Overview

Boids Chase is a 2D simulation-based game inspired by Craig Reynolds’ Boids model (1986).
The player controls a small character using WASD or Arrow Keys, attempting to survive waves of flocking enemies that hunt the player.

Each enemy flock uses standard flocking rules:

Separation – avoid crowding neighbors.

Alignment – move in the same direction as nearby boids.

Cohesion – move toward the average position of neighbors.

The game ends when:

The player survives all waves → Win Scene, or

A boid collides with the player → Game Over Scene.

🧩 Features

Start, Win, and Game Over screens.

Multiple enemy waves with difficulty scaling.

Fully coded flocking behavior in C#.

Minimalistic HUD and camera.

Keyboard-based movement system.
